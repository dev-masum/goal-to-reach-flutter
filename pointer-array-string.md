# C Pointer, Array & String Practice Problems

---

## 📌 POINTER PROBLEMS

### P1. Swap Two Numbers Using Pointers
Swap two integers by passing their addresses to a function.  
*Hint:* Use dereferencing and a temporary variable.

---

### P2. Traverse an Array Using Pointer Arithmetic
Print array elements using a pointer instead of indexing.  
*Hint:* Move the pointer using `ptr + i` or `ptr++`.

---

### P3. Pointer to Pointer
Access an integer value using a double pointer.  
*Hint:* One pointer stores the address of another pointer.

---

## 📌 ARRAY PROBLEMS

### A1. Sum of Array Elements
Calculate the sum of all elements in an array.  
*Hint:* Initialize sum to zero and add elements in a loop.

---

### A2. Find Maximum and Minimum in an Array
Find the largest and smallest values in an array.  
*Hint:* Assume the first element as both min and max.

---

### A3. Reverse an Array In-Place
Reverse the array without using extra memory.  
*Hint:* Swap elements from start and end indices.

---

### A4. Pass an Array to a Function
Print array elements using a function.  
*Hint:* Pass array name and size separately.

---

## 📌 STRING PROBLEMS

### S1. Find String Length Without `strlen()`
Compute the length of a string manually.  
*Hint:* Count characters until the null character `'\0'`.

---

### S2. Copy One String to Another Without `strcpy()`
Copy one string into another character by character.  
*Hint:* Don’t forget to add the null terminator.

---

### S3. Count Vowels and Consonants
Count vowels and consonants in a string.  
*Hint:* Check character ranges and ignore spaces.

---

### S4. Reverse a String Without Library Functions
Reverse a string manually.  
*Hint:* Use two indices or pointers from both ends.

---

### S5. Traverse a String Using Pointer
Print a string using a character pointer.  
*Hint:* Move the pointer until `'\0'` is reached.

---

### S6. Array of Strings
Store and print multiple strings using a 2D character array.  
*Hint:* Each row represents one string.

---

### S7. Find First Occurrence of a Character
Find the index of the first occurrence of a character.  
*Hint:* Stop searching once the character is found.

---

## 🔥 OPTIONAL CHALLENGES

### C1. Reverse Words in a Sentence
Reverse the order of words in a sentence.  
*Hint:* Identify word boundaries using spaces.

---

### C2. Count Frequency of Each Character
Count occurrences of each character in a string.  
*Hint:* Use an array indexed by ASCII values.
