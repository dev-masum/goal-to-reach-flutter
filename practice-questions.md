# C Programming – Practice Problems


---

## Problem 1: Variables, Data Types, and Output

Write a C program that:
- Declares variables using valid C naming conventions
- Uses int, float, double, and char data types
- Assigns appropriate values to each variable
- Prints the values in a formatted manner using printf
- Prints the size of each data type using sizeof

---

## Problem 2: Input and Arithmetic Operations

Write a C program that:
- Takes two integers as input using scanf
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus
- Demonstrates pre-increment and post-increment operators
- Prints all results clearly

---

## Problem 3: Relational, Logical, and Assignment Operators

Write a C program that:
- Accepts two integers from the user
- Evaluates all relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Evaluates logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Demonstrates assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
- Prints the result of each operation

---

## Problem 4: Bitwise Operators Demonstration

Write a C program that:
- Takes two integers as input
- Demonstrates bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift
- Prints the result of each bitwise operation

---

## Problem 5: Constants, Scope, and Storage Classes

Write a C program that:
- Defines a constant using #define
- Calculates the area of a circle
- Declares a global variable
- Declares a local variable with the same name inside a function
- Uses a static local variable inside a function
- Calls the function multiple times and prints all variable values

---

## Problem 6: Pointers and Memory Manipulation

Write a C program that:
- Declares an integer variable
- Stores its address in a pointer
- Modifies the variable value using the pointer
- Demonstrates pre-increment and post-increment through the pointer
- Prints addresses and values

---

## Problem 7: Special Operators and Structures

Write a C program that demonstrates the use of:
- sizeof operator
- Comma operator
- Address-of (&) and dereference (*) operators
- Array subscript operator ([])
- Function call operator ()
- Type casting
- Structure member (.) and structure pointer (->) operators

---

## Problem 8: Complete Integrated Practice Program

Write a comprehensive C program that:
1. Takes two integers as input
2. Performs arithmetic operations
3. Evaluates relational and logical expressions
4. Demonstrates bitwise operations
5. Uses assignment operators
6. Prints the size of variables
7. Modifies a variable using pointers
8. Uses a static variable inside a function
9. Prints all results in a well-formatted manner
